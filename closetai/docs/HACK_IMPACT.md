## 1. Helping Users Stay Fashionable Without Constant Shopping

### The Underutilisation Crisis

Wardrobe studies reveal a stark gap between clothing ownership and actual use. A 2025 study presented at the **PLATE2025 conference** found that:

> **Clothing utilisation has declined by over a third in the last 15 years**, with dresses being the least worn of any significant clothing item.

Consumers own more clothes than ever but wear them far less frequently, creating "hidden wardrobe waste" that drives unnecessary consumption.

**ClosetAI connection:** By helping users rediscover and restyle what they already own, the app directly addresses this utilisation crisis. Users don't need new clothes—they need new ways to wear existing ones.

### The 80% Solution: Fit, Occasion, Style

The **Torrens University** research identified three critical factors that determine whether clothing gets worn:

1. **Fit** – How well the garment accommodates body shape  
2. **Occasion** – Whether the item suits specific events or daily life  
3. **Style** – Alignment with personal aesthetic preferences  

> **If designers address these three factors alone, it could mitigate up to 80% of low usage issues.**

ClosetAI doesn't just catalog clothes—it actively helps users find the right fit, occasion-appropriate combinations, and style-aligned outfits from their existing wardrobe.

### Personal Factors Drive Sustainable Use

A 2024 study in *Cleaner and Responsible Consumption* examined what motivates people to wear clothes longer. The researchers found that personal factors—including **fashion trend sensitivity, style orientation, and frugality**—explain **80% of the variance in sustainable clothing use practices**.

Sustainable fashion behavior is not primarily about external pressure but about helping individuals express their style and stay engaged with trends using what they already own.

**ClosetAI connection:** Trend research (via You.com) helps users stay fashion-forward without buying new, while the style quiz and preference learning ensure recommendations align with personal taste. This activates the psychological drivers of sustainable clothing use.

### From "Buy Better" to "Use Better"

The fashion industry's sustainability conversation has long focused on "buying better"—choosing eco-friendly materials or ethical brands. However, the **use phase** of clothing—what happens after purchase—is "a carbon intensive phase of the product's lifespan that is squarely within the clothing user's control."

ClosetAI flips the paradigm: instead of guiding users toward new purchases, it maximizes the value of what they already own. **Sustainability through utilisation, not acquisition.**

## 2. Reducing Decision Fatigue with Data-Backed Suggestions

### The Overwhelm Crisis in Fashion

- **At least 70%** of online fashion customers abandon their cart each session  
- **One in four items** is returned  
- The primary reason: customers "could not visualize how something would fit their personal style or closet"

This isn't just a convenience issue—it's a cognitive crisis.

A 2023 **IEEE** study formally defined **choice fatigue** as:

> "The deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a long session of decision-making."

In online shopping environments "inundated with various product options," consumers experience information overload that makes shopping "time-consuming" and mentally exhausting.

### AI as a Cognitive Shield

A 2025 article in the *Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services* examined "the role of sophisticated AI in mitigating decision fatigue and purchase postponement in luxury retail." The study found that **AI-driven personalization significantly reduces the cognitive burden** of shopping decisions, helping consumers make confident choices without mental exhaustion.

The mechanism: when users face overwhelming options, they "rely on decision-making shortcuts." ClosetAI provides intelligent shortcuts—not generic bestseller lists, but **personalized recommendations based on the user's actual wardrobe, style preferences, and real-time trends**.

### Commercial Impact

A 2025 analysis from the **Rotterdam School of Management** synthesized multiple industry sources:

- **AI-powered personalization can increase sales conversion by 20–40%**  
- **Return rates can be reduced by 10–20%**, saving millions annually for retailers  
- The key is moving from "cold overwhelming algorithmic feeds" to "technology that empowers human judgement"

## 3. Synthesis: How ClosetAI Delivers Both Impacts

### The Causal Chain

1. **The Problem:** People own more clothes than ever but wear them less (33% decline in utilisation). They face overwhelming choices online (70% cart abandonment) and experience decision fatigue that degrades judgment.

2. **The Mechanism:** Three factors determine whether clothes get worn: fit, occasion, and style. Personal style orientation drives sustainable use. Structured, personalized recommendations reduce cognitive load.

3. **ClosetAI's Solution:**
   - **Upload & Analysis:** Digitizes wardrobe, extracts attributes, identifies fit and style  
   - **Smart Recommendations:** Combines occasion, weather, and trend data to suggest outfits users will actually wear  
   - **Virtual Try-On:** Lets users visualize combinations before committing (addressing the #1 return reason: "couldn't visualize")  
   - **Trend Research:** Keeps users fashion-forward without buying new  

4. **The Impact:** Users wear more of what they own (addressing up to 80% of low usage issues), make faster confident decisions (reducing fatigue), and stay stylish sustainably.

## Summary for Hackathon Submission

This research provides **rock-solid validation** for ClosetAI's real-world impact:

- **Users stay fashionable without buying new** because the app addresses the three factors that determine clothing use (fit, occasion, style)—potentially solving up to 80% of underutilisation issues. It helps them engage with trends using what they already own, activating the personal factors that drive sustainable behavior.

- **Users experience less decision fatigue** because data-backed suggestions provide cognitive shortcuts that research proves reduce overwhelm. Instead of facing infinite options, they receive personalized, context-aware recommendations that lead to confident decisions. This translates to fewer abandoned carts, fewer returns, and more mental energy for other life decisions.

By grounding the project in this research, ClosetAI demonstrates to judges that it isn't just a clever technical demo—**it's a solution to documented, measurable problems** in fashion consumption and consumer psychology.
